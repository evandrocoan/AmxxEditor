# Sublime AmxxEditor

This was initially a mirror from the Sublime AMXX-Editor available on:

1. [[Editor] Sublime AMXX-Editor v2.2](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=284385)


Now it is a fork filled within new settings and improvements. You can some of its features on:

1. [[TUT] Compiling AMXX plugins with Sublime Text](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=293376)

Its feature is auto-complete. This is the settings file: [AmxxEditor.sublime-settings](AmxxEditor.sublime-settings)


It had the purpose to be that's project fork, as it is not available on github at the moment.
To be used as a submodule at My Sublime Text Settings: https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio
