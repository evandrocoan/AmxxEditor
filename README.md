This was initially a mirror from the Sublime AMXX-Editor available on:

1. [[Editor] Sublime AMXX-Editor v2.2](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=284385)


Now it is a fork filled within new settings and improvements. You can some of its features on:

1. [[TUT] Compiling AMXX plugins with Sublime Text](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=293376)

Its feature is auto-complete. This is the settings file: [AmxxEditor.sublime-settings](AmxxEditor.sublime-settings)


It had the purpose to be that's project fork, as it is not available on github at the moment.
To be used as a submodule at My Sublime Text Settings: https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio

    wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
    Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
    ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
    (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
    Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
    ```js
    "channels":

        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
    ],
