# AmxxEditor 2.0.0 Breaking Changes

The new version of the AmxxEditor package has just been installed in your machine.

On this version, the package have been renamed from `AmxxEditor` to `AmxxEditor`. Also, its settings files
have been renamed. You will need to copy them from the old file to the new file:

1. `User/amxx.sublime-settings` to `User/AmxxEditor.sublime-settings`
1. `User/AMXX-Console.sublime-settings` to `User/AmxxEditorConsole.sublime-settings`

The standard syntax file has also been renamed from `AmxxEditor/AMXX-Pawn.sublime-syntax` to `AmxxEditor/AmxxEditor.sublime-syntax`.
