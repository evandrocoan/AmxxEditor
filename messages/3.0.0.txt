# AmxxEditor 3.0.0 Breaking Changes

The new version of the AmxxEditor package has just been installed in your machine.

1. `User/Amxmodx/AmxxPawn.bat` to `User/AmxxEditor/AmxxEditor.bat`

## Syntax files
1. `User/AmxmodxPawn.sublime-syntax`   to `User/AmxxEditorPawn.sublime-syntax`
2. `User/AmxmodxConsole.sublime-syntax`   to `User/AmxxEditorConsole.sublime-syntax`

## Settings files
1. `User/Amxmodx.sublime-settings`        to `User/AmxxEditor.sublime-settings`
2. `User/AmxmodxPawn.sublime-settings`    to `User/AmxxEditorPawn.sublime-settings`
3. `User/AmxmodxConsole.sublime-settings` to `User/AmxxEditorConsole.sublime-settings`
