# Amxmodx Version 2.0.0

The new version of the AMXXEditor package has just been installed in your machine.

On this version, the package have been renamed from `amxmodx` to `Amxmodx`. Also, its settings files
have been renamed. You will need to copy them from the old file to the new file:

1. `User/amxx.sublime-settings` to `User/Amxmodx.sublime-settings`
1. `User/AMXX-Console.sublime-settings` to `User/AmxmodxConsole.sublime-settings`

The standard syntax file has also been renamed from `amxmodx/AMXX-Pawn.sublime-syntax` to `Amxmodx/Amxmodx.sublime-syntax`.
